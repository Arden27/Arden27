Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Artem.  
I spend my sleepless nights scratching beyond the surface of the programming realm ðŸ™ƒ  
Check out some of my work:  
[Honey Marketplace](https://honey-marketplace.vercel.app/sklep) - The online store I'm currently working on in collaboration with another dev. Code [here](https://github.com/Arden27/honey_marketplace). Check out live [DEMO](https://honey-marketplace.vercel.app/sklep).  
[Receipts App](https://artman.pythonanywhere.com/receiptapp/login?portfolio=true) - A financial app for tracking expenses. Right now, it has the core functionality to CRUD the receipts, login, and DB sync. In a future update, I'm planning to add OCR for automatic receipt scanning and parsing. Code [here](https://github.com/Arden27/receipts). Check out live [DEMO](https://artman.pythonanywhere.com/receiptapp/login?portfolio=true).  
[Portfolio](https://artemfurman.tech) - Alpha version of my portfolio. It features a Chatbot Avatar I built; you can use it to ask any questions about my background and skills. Code is [here](https://github.com/Arden27/portfolio). Check out [LIVE](https://artemfurman.tech).  
[Flaw-to-crypto Converter](http://artman.pythonanywhere.com/flaws) - My first JQuery + Django pet-project before diving into React. A glimpse at my progress ðŸ™‚ Planning to rewrite this with TS/Next.js, as I have some funny ideas for it ðŸ¤” [Code](https://github.com/Arden27/flaw-to-crypto). Live demo is [here](http://artman.pythonanywhere.com/flaws).
